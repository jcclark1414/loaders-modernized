# Loaders Modernized

A Space Aged, compact loader the size of a single tile.  This loader should be UPS friendly and does
not use LUA to move items.  It also does not use hidden inserters to move inventory.  However, they
do use power.  So keep those power poles handy!

## Features

- Works in Factorio 2.0 and supports Space Age.
- Control circuit supported.
- Works with cargo wagons.
- Loaders snap to belts and away from non-belts.
- Stack items on to the belts based on belt stacking technology level.
- Split Lanes!!!
- AAI Loader graphics can be used as long as AAI Loader mode is installed.
- Able to migrate Miniloaders.

## Alternate belt set supported

- [Ultimate Belts Space Age](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/UltimateBeltsSpaceAge)
- [5Dim's New Transport](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/5dim_transport)

## Migrating from Miniloaders

**CAUTION: Backup your save file before migrating Miniloaders**
As a startup setting, you can enable migration of existing Miniloaders.  This will attempt to find all
miniloaders and replace them with equivalent Loaders Modernized.  This may not be perfect, and I'll fix
what I can when reported.  Please backup your save file before attempting migration.  Specific Belt
overhaul mods are not implemented yet.  Please drop a message if one is needed.

## TODO

- Support belts from additional overhaul mods.
